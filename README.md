NYC Soccer Matchday is a lightweight web MVP that helps fans find NYC bars showing a specific soccer match. It highlights bar type (general vs club-specific) and live social signals like “people going,” while allowing bar owners to post simple matchday updates. Built with a tight MVP scope using AI-assisted vibe coding.
